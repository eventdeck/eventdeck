Over the course of his career, he has been responsible for many discoveries, inventions and innovations in science, technology and business.\"\n\n\"In recognition of his early work in physics and computing, Wolfram became in 1981 the youngest recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. Late in 1981 Wolfram then set out on an ambitious new direction in science aimed at understanding the origins of complexity in nature. Wolfram's first key idea was to use computer experiments to study the behavior of simple computer programs known as cellular automata. And starting in 1982, this allowed him to make a series of startling discoveries about the origins of complexity. The papers Wolfram published quickly had a major impact, and laid the groundwork for the emerging field that Wolfram called \"complex systems research.\"\n\n\"Wolfram began the development of Mathematica in late 1986. The first version of Mathematica was released on June 23, 1988, and was immediately hailed as a major advance in computing. In the years that followed, the popularity of Mathematica grew rapidly, and Wolfram Research became established as a world leader in the software industry, widely recognized for excellence in both technology and business. \"\n\n\"In recent years, Wolfram's penchant for innovation has been applied ever more widely. Building on the deep technology stacks associated with Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha, the advances of A New Kind of Science, and the success of his business endeavors, Wolfram is now developing technology and products in several important new directions.\"\n\nSite: http://www.stephenwolfram.com/\nBlog: http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/stephen_wolfram\nLinkedin: http://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenwolfram\nSpeaking enquiries: sw-staff@wolfram.com"

My most well known one is Rebuild, a post-apocalyptic strategy game for browsers and mobile phones. It's not your usual shoot-the-zombies-in-the-head kind of game; instead you manage a city of survivors and have to make tough decisions to keep them alive. It's written in Adobe Flash (AS3 / AIR) and took me about a year to make. I'm currently working on Rebuild 3, which I raised money for on Kickstarter.\n\n(...) \nHow did you learn to program?\nI loved computers from a young age in the 80s and 90s, because I loved the games you could play on them. I learned shell scripting so I could run games, learned how to use BBSes so I could download games, then learned HTML so I could make websites about... I'll let you guess. I did my earliest real programming in first year college and fell in love with the world of puzzles and language that sits inside every piece of software. To me, programming is a game.\nI majored in computer science, which involved far too much math and theory and circuit boards for my liking. I learned the most from working on projects that interested me, not from books or teachers. (...)

Como devem saber, existem já vários serviços de cloud gaming como o OnLive, Gaikai e o NVIDIA GRID (entre outros?). Pelo que parece a Valve também vai integrar um sistema de streaming na SteamBox e em Portugal temos o MEO Jogos. No entanto, para todos os efeitos, não sei se estes dois últimos são pela cloud ou não. A Microsoft também está a trabalhar em algo parecido, mas acho que ainda não foi nada oficializado ou anunciado.\n\nA Gaikai faz parte dos serviços mais importantes de cloud gaming da actualidade. Foi fundada inicialmente pelo Andrew Gault e pelo português (e actual CTO) Rui Pereira. Mais tarde, o David Perry (actual CEO) veio a fazer parte da equipa como co-fundador. Foi recentemente adquirida pela Sony e, supostamente, será bastante importante nos seus produtos mais recentes (PS4, PSVita, tablets, portáteis, etc). A sua tecnologia está actualmente a ser usada para o Remote Play da PS4 e vai ser usada para o seu serviço de cloud gaming agora denominado PlayStation Now (que, se não me engano está actualmente em fase BETA).\n\nNão encontro nenhum vídeo ou notícia de palestras/painéis dados pelo Rui Pereira, portanto não sei até que ponto seria favorável ou não trazê-lo cá. A única vantagem que vejo é o facto de ele ser português. Por outro lado, o David Perry tem imensas talks/palestras/etc online e fez inclusivamente parte do evento onde foi anunciada pela primeira vez a PS4. Ambos residem actualmente na Califórnia.\n\nA ideia é obviamente convidar um ou o outro. No ano passado tentei apenas contactar o David Perry via facebook e através do seguinte e-mail: dperry@gmail.com, mas não obtive resposta. Desta vez posso chatear um ou o outro via linkedin, visto que já sou amigaço deles lá. Pelo twitter não faço ideia se dá para mandar msg pessoal. Nunca usei aquilo na vida. lol"

É que é dos maiores de MIR, actualmente. A carteira de clientes da Echonest é uma coisa arrebatadora, caraças.\nE, quem gostar de protótipos muito imaginativos, vá ao blog dele. Aliás, já sugeri à Claudia para colocar um dos hacks, que ele fez, no facebook da SINFO.\nChatice: ele está nos EUA. Ou seja, como já temos muitos custos, sugeria que ficasse para o ano.\n\nEDIT: esqueci-me de dizer que ele é bué apologista de hackatons. Então, se forem protótipos que usem a API da Echonest, é só dizer.\n\n\nNOTA 1: A Echonest foi comprada pela Spotify.\n\nNOTA 2: Ele quer mesmo vir, falem com ele para tratarem dos prazos."
